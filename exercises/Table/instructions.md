- create a responsive table without JavaScript
- use a normal HTML table and change its design only with CSS (use breakpoints)
- you can change the colors and text however you want
- add hover effect for the table-rows

-- some help --
in mobile view hide the thead and show it inside the :before state with content: attr(data-title);
